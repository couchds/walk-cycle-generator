# Quadruped Walk Cycle Generator

A Blender add-on that generates looping walk-cycle keys for four-legged armatures. It can animate foot or paw IK target bones when the rig has them, or fall back to simple FK rotation on upper/lower/foot bone chains.

## Install

1. Zip the `quadruped_walk_cycle` folder, or keep the folder as-is for development.
2. In Blender, open `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install...`.
3. Select the zip file or the `quadruped_walk_cycle/__init__.py` file.
4. Enable **Quadruped Walk Cycle Generator**.
5. Select an armature and open `View3D > Sidebar > QWalk`.

## Basic Use

1. Select the animal armature, or click **Create Quadruped Armature** to make a starter rig.
2. Click **Auto Map Bones** when using your own rig. The generated starter rig maps itself automatically.
3. Review the mapped fields. Auto mapping is best-effort because rigs use wildly different naming conventions.
4. Choose a gait: Walk, Trot, Pace, or Bound.
5. Choose generation mode:
   - **Auto**: uses IK target bones where mapped, otherwise FK chains.
   - **IK Targets**: animates mapped foot or paw controls by location.
   - **FK Chains**: animates mapped upper, lower, and foot bones by Euler rotation.
6. Set stride, lift, frame range, and axes.
7. Click **Generate Walk Cycle**.

The add-on adds cyclic F-curve modifiers by default so the generated cycle loops past the selected frame range.

## Rig Expectations

For best results, use a rig with four foot or paw IK target/control bones:

- Front left IK
- Front right IK
- Rear left IK
- Rear right IK

If the rig does not have IK controls, map each leg as an FK chain:

- Upper bone
- Lower bone
- Foot/paw/hoof bone

The generator assumes one local axis is forward, one is side-to-side, and one is up. Defaults are:

- Forward: `Y`
- Side: `X`
- Up: `Z`

If the motion goes sideways, backwards, or downward, change the axis settings before regenerating.

## Generated Starter Armature

Click **Create Quadruped Armature** to generate a simple +Y-forward, Z-up quadruped rig. The default display is **Stick**, which reads more like a rig than a blocky proxy animal. The operator has a **Profile** option; `Medium Quadruped` is the default, `Stocky Quadruped` is better for compact goat/sheep/ram-like bodies, and `Horse` provides a longer body, neck, and limb template.

The generated rig includes:

- `root`, `body`, `pelvis`, `chest`, `neck`, `head`, and tail bones
- Four named FK leg chains such as `front_left_upper`, `front_left_lower`, and `front_left_foot`
- Four IK targets such as `front_left_ik`
- Four pole controls such as `front_left_pole`
- Optional IK constraints from each lower-leg bone to its IK target

The starter armature is meant as a clean animation test rig and naming template, not a production-ready anatomy rig. Use Blender's operator redo panel after creation if you want a different profile or Octahedral, B-Bone, or Wire display instead.

New generated rigs open in Pose Mode with the main animation controls selected. The control widgets are stored as hidden mesh objects in a `*_widgets` collection and assigned as custom bone shapes.

## Mesh Fitting Phase 1

Select a mesh and click **Create Fitted Quadruped Armature** to place a generated armature from coarse mesh landmarks. This first phase estimates the ground, main torso span, upper back surface, foot contact areas, and broad body type:

- Leave `Profile` set to `Auto` for the add-on to choose Medium, Stocky, or Horse proportions from the mesh bounds.
- Choose a specific `Profile` in the operator redo panel when you already know the animal type.
- Choose `Mesh Forward` based on the direction from tail toward head.
- Adjust `Fit` if the rig should sit tighter or looser inside the mesh.
- Leave `Robust Bounds` enabled for meshes with horns, manes, fur, bulky tails, or other silhouettes that should not dominate the vertical fit. The fitter detects the main torso span before measuring the spine, so horns and head volume are less likely to pull the back line upward.

This does not bind the mesh yet. It only creates a fitted armature.

## Notes

- **Replace Keys** removes existing location/Euler rotation keys on mapped bones only inside the selected frame range.
- **Set Base Pose** stores the current mapped transforms as the neutral pose used by future generations.
- IK mode only moves target/control bones. Your rig's IK constraints still determine the final limb bending.
- FK mode is intentionally generic. It gives a usable blocking pass, but animal-specific polish usually still needs animator cleanup.
- `FK Swing`, `FK Lift`, and `FK Bend` only apply when the current mode resolves to FK. The panel disables them when the mapped rig is using IK.
- The first and last frames are keyed to match, making the cycle loop cleanly.

## Package Layout

Blender loads the add-on from `quadruped_walk_cycle/__init__.py`, while the implementation is split into focused modules:

- `constants.py`: leg labels and property field names
- `gaits.py`: gait presets and stride math
- `bone_mapping.py`: best-effort bone-name detection
- `rig_utils.py`: armature, axis, keyframe, and F-curve helpers
- `skeleton.py`: starter quadruped armature generation
- `properties.py`: Blender scene settings
- `operators.py`: auto-map, generate, and clear operators
- `ui.py`: QWalk sidebar panel
